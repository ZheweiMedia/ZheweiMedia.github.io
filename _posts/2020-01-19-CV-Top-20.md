   1.1 Two  benefits of the architecture

    1. Connects high-to-low resolution sub-networks in parallel rather than in series as done in most existing solutions.
    2. Repeated multi-scale  fusions  to  boost  the  high-resolution representations with the help of  the  low-resolution  representations  of  the same depth and similar level,  and vice versa.

8. Relation Networks for Object Detection
   Define relations between objects by adopting attention mechanism. In their work, it largely used for remove duplicate detection.

9. Learning Region Features for Object Detection
    Local features without RoI pooling.

10. Local Relation Networks for Image Recognition
    another relation networks on ImageNet.

14. Deformable ConvNets v2: More Deformable, Better Results

16. A Twofold Siamese Network for Real-Time Object Tracking
    Tracking with help pf semantic.

27. Learning Pyramid Context Encoder Network for High-Quality Image Inpainting
    Attention of pyramid.

29. Structured Knowledge Distillation forDense Prediction
